	IN PROGRESS. Centralize the use of utility classes in a $ class, like a jquery thing.
	Test criterias by example
	Make a function to replace dots, in class names, with hyphens.
	Get rid of parentId on Event
	Find a combination of jackson versions that work with the option for FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS
	Extract to method: fillObject() in Entities.js to remove duplicated code in Event.js
	Refactor service.hasUpdates() taking into account groups of objects pertaining to a specific parent id. (today, as soon as any object is updated on a service, it returns true for hasUpdates(), it should be made so that one can query for updates for children of a specific parent. e.g.: hasUpdates(listingId))
